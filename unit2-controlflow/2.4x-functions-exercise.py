# Write a program that calculates the area of a rectangle.
# Do this using two functions: calculateArea and main.

# calculateArea should take two parameters, length and width.
# The body of the function should multiply those together and
# assign the product to a variable called area. Return the
# value of this variable.

# The main function takes no parameters. In the body, prompt the 
# user for two strings: length and width. Cast them to floats
# called x and y. Call the calculateArea function, using x and y
# as arguments. Print the result to the user.

# Finally, call the main function. Remember that a function won't
# execute until it's called!

    area = (length * width)

    length = input("Type a length")

    y = float(width)
    results = calculateArea(x, y)
    print("The area of the rectangle is ",results)
